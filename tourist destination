<h1>Yankee Meadow is the Place to visit!</h1>
<h2>Fishing in Grantsville Lake</h2>
<p>The fist are biting! You could catch rainbow trout or minnows. Cold weather is coming. Come out and enjoy the sunshine before the snow hits us!</p>

<h2>sightseeing</h2>
<p>There are deer, squirrels, groundhogs, chipmunk, and the prettiest birds found out here in Yankee Meadow. There are signs up bewaring of bear, but I have yet to see a bear or a cougar.<br>
Do not feed the animals. They will get fat. They will lose their wilderness survival skills. They will forget how to hunt for their own food.</p>
Overnight camping is not currently available. Two years ago Brianhead was engulfed in flames and much of it burnt down despite the firemans efforts. It has had two years to grow back and it looks AMAZING! For safety reasons campers cannot sleep overnight in Yankee Meadows. What a beautiful location for a daytrip! <br>
If you forgot to bring snacks or supplies there is a Market and a gas station close by in Parowan. <br>
Bring your fishing pool, tinfoil dinner, and binoculars. Be ready to have a great time relaxing in nature!</p>
